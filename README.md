## 📖 Overview

**The S.H.I.E.L.D. Protocol** is a machine learning classification project designed to analyze meta-human data and predict whether an unknown entity is a **Hero** or a **Villain**. By ingesting data such as power levels, origin story sentiment, and behavioral attributes, this tool solves the critical bottleneck of delayed threat assessment during planetary crises.

## ✨ Features

* 🦸‍♂️ **Meta-Human Data Preprocessing:** Automated cleaning of missing power stats, outlier handling for cosmic-level entities, and encoding of categorical abilities.
* 🧠 **Classification Models:** Implements and compares multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to find the most accurate threat predictor.
* 📊 **Threat-Level Visualizations:** Generates feature importance charts to show which traits (e.g., "tragic backstory" vs. "billionaire status") most heavily influence villainy.
* 📓 **Interactive Jupyter Environment:** The entire pipeline from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to model evaluation is documented step-by-step in an easy-to-read notebook.
